Who am I?

I am an aspiring epidemiologist / data scientist that is focused on working with the public sector to promote infectious disease related health at home and abroad. I come with a diverse set of experiences, having previous worked in construction project management, volunteered in domestic and international hospitals, and interned at the WHO. I am a pragmatic communicator that is detail oriented and mission driven, and am eager to apply what I have learned to promote research and public awareness of vaccine preventable diseases. I believe that population dynamics are not equal to the sum of its individual parts, and through statistics and epidemiological inquiry vital questions can be uncovered and elucidated.
