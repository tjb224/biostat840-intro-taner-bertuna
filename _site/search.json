    "text": "I am a current second year master of science (ScM) student studying infectious disease epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I previously received a BA in Government with a focus on international relations from Cornell University. While in undergrad, I competed on the Cornell University Sailing Team from 2012 to 2016.\nI am interested in infectious disease modelling and its applications in the fight against vaccine preventable diseases. Having previously volunteered over 200 hrs in clinical settings, interned at the WHO, and worked in project management on the construction of a 50 story skyscraper, I believe that my unique set of experiences have brought me to Johns Hopkins where I have discovered my passion for epidemiology and data science.\nI am currently working for the JHU Department of Epidemiology on a COVID-19, Cholera, and Hepatitis E serologic survey of Chittagong Bangladesh. This work will is also associated with my masters thesis, focused on exploring Cholera related healthcare seeking in the study cohort. I also work at the JHU’s International Vaccine Access Center on several projects related to COVID-19 modeling and COVID-19 vaccine health systems."
